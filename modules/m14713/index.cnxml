      <para id="id19969338"><figure id="id18361973"><media id="idm6866208" alt=""><image src="../../media/graphics1-2391.jpg" mime-type="image/jpeg" height="127" width="104"/></media></figure>Kim will be writing on a number of related topics that integrate <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS">Free Libre Open Source Software</link> (FLOSS) and free knowledge and equality in education, while also posing questions about what we mean by equality in education and the implications for digital inclusion. The term “libre” distinguishes freeware (gratis software) from <link url="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition">free software</link>, which encompasses use, modification, and distribution.</para>
      <para id="id20245199">Kim is currently working as a researcher at the <link url="http://www.meraka.org.za/">Meraka Institute</link>, managed by the <link url="http://www.csir.co.za/">Council for Scientific and Industrial Research</link> (CSIR) in South Africa. The main focus of his research is the introduction of technology and collaborative learning opportunities, and FLOSS for knowledge sharing and education. Kim also provides general advocacy of FLOSS and libre knowledge. His background includes some cognitive psychology, computer science lecturing, environmental decision support-systems development and other aspects of software development (Java, architecture, patterns, agile methodologies, etc.), and conservation biology (M.Sc.). Given this background, he has an interest in knowledge patterns, collaboration, and knowledge transfer across disciplines. In the context of Open Educational Resources (OER) he likes to promote the concept of “libre learning,” emphasizing the freedoms that users of OERs (or, rather, “libre” resources) should enjoy to permit unrestrained social constructivist (student-driven) learning in the emerging “rip, mix, and share” culture.</para>

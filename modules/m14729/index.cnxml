  <md:abstract>Kim Tucker's contribution to the "OSS and OER in Education Series." In this post, he touches on a number of related topics that integrate Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) and free knowledge and equality in education, while also posing questions about what we mean by equality in education and the implications for digital inclusion. The term “libre” distinguishes freeware (gratis software) from free software, which encompasses use, modification, and distribution.</md:abstract>

      and the broader impact on <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development">sustainable development</link>.</para>

      <title>Topic Revisited</title>
      
    <para id="element-479">Regarding the topic, “Impact of OSS on Education,”
      I suspect that both education and software development are subject to similar influences as
      technology enables connections among people with common interests and learning needs.</para>
    <para id="element-462">For example, it is difficult to determine the impact of <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS">FLOSS</link> (Free Libre Open Source Software) on
      education - the context is enabling educators and learners to benefit from the connectedness
      FLOSS communities have enjoyed and made good use of for more than a decade. Knowledge sharing
      across FLOSS and <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">OER</link> communities seems to have streamlined (stimulated, facilitated and catalysed)
      FLOSS adoption and technology-assisted collaborative learning in the education space. Several
      FLOSS projects have been pedagogically inspired (e.g. <link url="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</link>, <link url="http://fle3.uiah.fi">Fle3</link>, <link url="http://avoir.uwc.ac.za">Kewl.NextGen</link>, etc.), while others have been orientated
      (initially or primarily) towards administration (e.g. <link url="http://www.sakaiproject.org/">Sakai</link>, <link url="http://www.schooltool.org/">SchoolTool</link>, etc.).</para>
    <para id="element-692">FLOSS communities, and more recently Wikipedia communities, have been
      inspirational in demonstrating what can be achieved through <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production">commons-based peer
        production</link>. We are rising to the challenge of realising this level of success in
      education through libre and open resources for education. Efforts in this direction include
        <link url="http://cnx.org">Connexions</link>, <link url="http://wikieducator.org">Wikieducator</link> and <link url="http://exelearning.org">eXe</link>, <link url="http://lemill.net/">Le Mill</link>, <link url="http://educommons.org">EduCommons</link>, <link url="http://www.wikiversity.org">Wikiversity</link>, and many more.</para>
    <para id="element-302">All of these run on FLOSS platforms, all have followed open (transparent)
      development processes, and all carefully consider open standards and reusability of learning
      components (variously called learning objects, iDevices, etc, …).</para>
    <para id="element-388">However, for reusability in education, “localisation/
      recontextualisation is always required.” The educational and learning needs vary
      across contexts. Interestingly, agile software development teams seldom code for re-use unless
      development of re-usable components is core to their business (Alistair Cockburn, late 1990s,
      Cape Town; see for example <link url="http://c2.com/xp/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</link>).</para>
    <para id="element-811">Note that this type of peer production activity has been most evident in
      the “developed” world. <link url="http://www.benkler.org">Yochai
      Benkler</link> emphasizes that most of his research on peer production has focused on the more
      powerful economies.</para>

      <title> A1. Is the learning about FLOSS, Open Content and peer production applicable in
        developing economies?</title>
    <para id="element-871">Most of the population does not have access to the facilities that enable
      peer-production (personal computers, the Internet and high bandwidth). However, the cultures
      seem well disposed towards collaborative knowledge production.</para>
    <para id="element-993">“Developing” countries typically include
      “developed” areas functioning as part of the global knowledge economy.</para>
    <para id="element-157">Conversely, some “developed” countries face
      challenges normally associated with “developing” countries (such as
      poverty, health issues, unemployment, unequal access to education and public services, etc.) -
      though the scales may be vastly different.</para>
    <para id="element-865">Developing countries are generally not entrenched in set ways of using
      ICT in education. This is an opportunity to develop, adopt and adapt new and contextually
      appropriate approaches, and to build innovative supporting software infrastructures to address
      local/regional needs. FLOSS, free/open content, open standards, and <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_file_format">free file format</link>s permit this
        <link url="http://www.ftisa.org.za">freedom to innovate</link>.</para>
    <para id="element-757">By addressing the issues where they can be addressed, we will be better
      prepared to service new areas and people when they become connected (for example, if software
      and learning resources are already localised)</para>

        <section id="A2">
      <title>A2. What are the priorities for education, and how could FLOSS have an
      impact?</title>
    <para id="element-915">In many schools, the priorities are for buildings, water supply,
      electricity, nutrition for the learners, health, etc.. These needs mirror those of the
      communities. If <link url="http://searchsmb.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid44_gci928405,00.html">ICT</link>
      (Information Communications Technology) is indeed an enabler for meeting development needs,
      then the priority software and knowledge resources are those which facilitate access to
      knowledge on sustainable agriculture, primary health care, technical/vocational and
      entrepreneurial skills, and survival in the relevant context.</para>
    <para id="element-406">There is a worldwide shortage of teachers, and learners do not
      necessarily have parents available to support them in doing what it takes to get an education.</para>
    <para id="element-399">HIV AIDS is having an impact on the age pyramid in developing countries,
      eroding not only the aged cohorts, who form a key part of the extended family support systems,
      but of the current adult generations. The result is a lack of leadership from the aged, a lack
      of income and parental care, and care for the aged - a lost generation “Beyond
      Thunderdome.”</para>
    <para id="element-371">Institutions might (initially) prioritise administrative software over
      pedagogically inspired technology and resources. Learners the reverse, and educators need
      both. FLOSS packages for both of these functions are gradually being integrated.</para>
    <para id="element-129">Efforts to localise software may lead to redesign and development of
      completely new systems after analysing the local needs.</para>
    <para id="element-56">Creating one’s own educational resources, relevant to the local
      context, may prove easier and more effective than re-using resources obtained from elsewhere.</para>
    <para id="element-922">Priorities may be viewed from a global level. For example, FLOSS and open
      content show great promise towards the “Education for All” goal (<link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO</link> and others), and are key enablers
      towards achieving the <link url="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development

      <emphasis>Motivators</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="element-367">In South Africa, after some lobbying by technical people with an
      understanding of the broader implications, the motivation for FLOSS adoption in government was
      driven top-down. The intention is to release funds previously earmarked for software licensing
      for use in capacity development and for addressing other development needs, while developing
      the local ICT industries and effecting self-determination (at least in terms of the software
      we use). The following documents were produced as part of the process:</para>

    <para id="element-316">However, some government departments have gone ahead of this process and
      conducted partial FLOSS migrations of their own. I expect this type of “do what is
      needed” will continue with innovative individuals leading in response to the needs
      of the communities they serve.</para>
    <para id="element-866">Motivation at other levels typically relate to improved software
      development processes, greater flexibility and reduced licensing costs.</para>
    <para id="element-11">A key motivator implicit in this posting is to do the right thing.</para>
    <para id="element-875">
      <emphasis>Barriers</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="element-704">The barriers to FLOSS adoption were discussed previously (see posting by
      Pat Masson). More generally, in terms of participation in the knowledge society, using current
      technology, there are several building blocks which reflect part of the challenge we face for
      maximum impact:</para>
    <list id="element-877" list-type="enumerated">
      <item>Basic literacy - learn to read, ideally in one’s own language.</item>
      <item>Computer literacy - e.g. mouse, keyboard, files and folders, …, or the
        equivalent features on a cell phone, etc.</item>
      <item>Using office software - for employability.</item>
      <item>Content (co-)creation - localisation and creation of multimedia knowledge resources.</item>
      <item>Sharing resources.</item>

      <item>Engaging in decision making processes at higher levels.</item>
    </list>
    <para id="element-996">What opportunities do these present to FLOSS and OER developers, and to
      the communities of users? Which initiatives exist already providing or developing such
      building blocks? What should be prioritised to streamline participation in the global
      knowledge society?</para>

        <section id="A4">
      <title>A4. If we could provide access to all the world’s knowledge and
        educational resources, would we have “equality in education”? What
        does that mean? </title>
    <para id="element-62">Equality does not end at “access” unless we define
      “access” to mean physical access (to a computer or some other device)
      with sufficient bandwidth, and the ability to use the resources effectively. Relevance of the
      resources is important, as is the freedom to adapt/modify and share alike.</para>
    <para id="element-966">The barriers alluded to previously apply.</para>
    <para id="element-364">
      <emphasis>Some General Comments</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="element-895">
      <emphasis>Early Adoption of FLOSS by the OER Community</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="element-346">The OER community is quick to adopt FLOSS and develop and integrate
      features to support their learners. Recently, this has been incorporation of Web 2.0 features
      (mashups, use of resources such as <link url="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</link>, <link url="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</link>, <link url="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</link>,
        <link url="http://maps.google.com/">GoogleMaps</link>, etc.). This is all great - where
      sufficient bandwidth is available at all times.</para>
    <para id="element-141">
      <emphasis>Bandwidth and Learning Resources</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para id="element-652">Recognising the bandwidth issue in much of the developing world, a group
      of people came up with the idea of “Education in a Box” which later
      became “Education out of the Box” - a collection of CDs containing FLOSS
      and free/open content for Education. The intention was to set up a web site with resources
      from which one could select and download for use in a local setting. The recipients would be
      free to use, copy, learn with, adapt, improve and share - i.e. take control of their own
      destinies and offer professional services (such as localisation, redistribution, support,
      etc.) enhancing the potential impact of these resources on meeting local needs.</para>
    <para id="element-296">The project did not receive direct funding but was supported indirectly
      by the Developer Roadshows (OSI, <link url="http://www.osisa.org/">OSISA</link> and <link url="http://www.osiwa.org/en/node">OSIWA</link>). It is a “libre
      project” - anyone is free to take <link url="http://www.developer-roadshow.org/wa/wiki/CurrentContentOfEducationOutofTheBox">the
        idea</link> further in their own way.</para>
    <para id="element-450">Initiatives in South Africa which provide FLOSS and free/open content,
      which have exchanged notes, include the <link url="http://www.digitaldoorway.co.za">Digital
        Doorway</link> (minimally invasive education), the <link url="http://www.freedomtoaster.org">FreedomToaster</link>, and <link url="http://www.tuxlabs.co.za">tuXlabs</link>. The latter
      started out deploying FLOSS computer labs in schools, developing an effective methodology for
      doing this. At last count there were over 240 schools with tuXlabs. <link url="http://www.schoolnet.na">SchoolNet Namibia</link> has done something similar with over
      340 schools so far. The FreedomToaster provides FLOSS and some free educational content to
      anyone who arrives with blank CDs/DVDs. The digital doorway provides access to people in
      environments not normally suitable for computers (on account of crime and vandalism for
      example).</para>
    <para id="element-778">For connectivity within a community, the <link url="http://wirelessafrica.meraka.org.za">WirelessAfrica</link> project suggests ways in
      which a community may set up a network. If there is high bandwidth to the Internet available
      somewhere in the community, everyone may gain access via the mesh.</para>
    <para id="element-42">Computer labs may not be a great way to support learning with ICT in
      schools with limited resources. <link url="http://www.laptop.org">One laptop per child</link>
      is one alternative poised to be launched in several countries in the near future. Mobile phone
      penetration tends to be much higher in developing countries than for personal computers. <link url="http://mobiled.uiah.fi">MobilED</link> is one project exploring use of mobile phones in
      education.</para>
    <para id="element-276">In terms of language barriers, there are research projects looking at
      tools to help with translation, text to speech, etc. See for example, the work of the <link url="http://www.meraka.org.za/hlt">Meraka Institute’s HLT group</link></para>
    <para id="element-314">Regarding FLOSS capacity building see <link url="http://openicdl.org">Open ICDL</link> and <link url="http://learnlinux.tsf.org.za/">Learn Linux</link> as two
      examples in South Africa. More broadly, a new project is starting to gain momentum: <link url="http://www.wikieducator.org/FLOSS4Edu">FLOSS4Edu</link>.</para>
    <para id="element-85">The golden thread running through all the initiatives above is the
      emphasis on FLOSS and sharing the learning - libre knowledge.</para>
    <para id="element-449">I hope the trend generalises towards a vision such as
      “Enabling individuals and communities to empower themselves with knowledge, towards
      wisdom, for a sustainable world”.</para>
    <para id="element-569">Defining “equality” is difficult, and the
      challenges around achieving it are significant. It seems to me that best we can do is
      endeavour to maximise the options and opportunities for individuals and the freedoms to take
      these opportunities, whatever their context.</para>

    <para id="element-911">Kim, I have found this to be a very thought provoking and information
      rich posting. As I read through the questions that you asked and the abbreviated responses
      that you provided, I kept returning to a number of related questions of my own. The principal
      question being:</para>
    <para id="element-43">Is there the need to develop curriculum around commons-based peer
      development?</para>
    <para id="element-882">That is, would treating commons-based peer development through the formal
      educational curriculum in primary, secondary, and tertiary education across an array of topics
      and subject areas strike at equity issues associated with access? Would it help to generate a
      culture that supports and actively promotes peer development, investment in technologies that
      support collaborative creation, law that favors (reduces barriers and creates incentives)
      community production, etc?</para>
    <para id="element-849">If so, it would seem natural for FLOSS and OER to be used as practical
      applications areas within a curriculum and also serve as sources of examples (artifacts) to be
      studied and refined. If it were possible to integrate commons-based peer development into an
      action-oriented curriculum, following for example a participatory action research approach to
      facilitated teaching and learning, a virtuous cycle could develop in which FLOSS and OER
      production and use impacts education, formal education becomes directly relevant to societal
      change, and societal change in turn promotes and is fueled by the use of FLOSS and OER in
      education. Eventually the application of the skills and patterns developed through the active
      study of commons-based peer development are also applied to the production of other
      intellectual capacity (work flows, processes, physical artifacts, etc.).</para>
    <para id="element-6">In partial response to your first question, “<cite><cite-title>Q1. Is the
        learning from and between FLOSS, OER and other peer production case studies applicable in
        “developing” economies?</cite-title></cite>” I believe that a curriculum
      that includes commons-based peer development principles would be more likely to thrive in
      “developing” economies than in developed economies that have a whole
      value system based on deformed information markets (artificial barriers that impede the free
      flow of information and ideas).</para>

      Your coverage of cutting edge projects across the globe is impressive and you always provide a

    <para id="element-84">Certainly include cbpp-like learning activities (among others) for most
      curriculi (learn by doing) - reminiscent of progressive inquiry and social constructionist
      activities highlighted in FLOSS such as <link url="http://fle3.uiah.fi">http://fle3.uiah.fi</link> and <link url="http://www.moodle.org">http://www.moodle.org.</link> [In both of these, developments in the software were inspired
      by learning theory (and not the other way round)].</para>
    <para id="element-576">For teacher training curriculi … yes! - facilitating learning
      via cbpp. If learners have access, collaboration with peers will occur, the challenge for
      teachers is to become facilitators and keep the learners “productive”
      towards common goals. In South Africa, it has been our experience that it is difficult to
      convince teachers to change their ways (another challenge) - building this into teacher
      training will ensure that the new crop of teachers is well primed.</para>
    <para id="element-741">I agree it would strike at equity issues: enabling people to empower
      themselves with knowledge and to be able to engage in cbpp.</para>
    <para id="element-431">One of Yochai Benkler’s claims is that “when you
      have the kind of information/cultural production system that wikipedia represents, injected
      into modern complex democracies, you can see significant improvements in autonomy, democracy
      and, to a limited extent but with some probability, social justice or at least a more just
      form of global development.” (YB, Wikimania 2006).</para>
    <para id="element-820">My concern is that most people in developing countries do not have
      access, so such benefits will not be as pronounced or immediate. In the interim, it might be
      better to assemble connected experts in the countries to produce base educational content of
      high quality and get that out there however possible (e.g. in printed form as Wayne suggests)
      - perhaps including peer production-type or social construction activities which do not
      require Internet access. Again, skilled facilitation may be necessary to achieve inclusiveness
      among participants.</para>
    <para id="element-200">Re: would it help to generate a culture that supports and actively
      promotes peer development, … [and] … law that favors …
      community production, etc?</para>
    <para id="element-122">One thing we must do is question our assumptions, and I suspect there are
      some in the implicit affirmative answer to this question. Would it help what? (reduce
      inequalities of access to knowledge/learning?). Whom would it help in what way? (those that
      are ahead already may simply move further ahead together at a faster rate). When? (only after
      people have physical access to computers and the Internet?). Why do we think this is
      important? (will it lead to a sustainable planet and world peace?).</para>
    <para id="element-386">A question which arises for me (which might help map out intermediate
      objectives) is “Why do we not have such a culture right now?” - Perhaps
      we do, but behaviour is modified by the restrictive legal and economic climate created by
      those with a vested interest in outdated business models (Wikipedia, Apache and GNU/Linux
      exist in spite of the dominant economic models and legal climate). The Creative Commons offers
      a way round the legal restraints, and we see a blossoming of new business models in the open
      source world (http://www.opensourcestrategies.org/ ) and in publishing (e.g. <link url="http://icommons.org/2007/03/29/new-business-models-are-catching-on-%e2%80%93-lethem-gives-away-film-rights/">http://icommons.org/2007/03/29/new-business-models-are-catching-on-%e2%80%93-lethem-gives-away-film-rights/</link>).</para>
    <para id="element-375">However, there is still a need to counter the pervading overly
      restrictive copyright regime.</para>
    <para id="element-146">So, I agree, it would help to embed cbpp activities across the
      curriculum, and to use FLOSS and free/libre/open resources for education as examples, etc.</para>
    <para id="element-980">Re: the virtuous cycle you described:</para>
    <para id="element-805">The chain might well work. It reminds me of what sounded to me like an
      empassioned plea from Larry Lessig at Wikimania last year: to demonstrate the benefits of
      cbpp, sharing of knowledge and a read-write Internet to society in areas beyond Wikipedia.
      Efforts in the education space (such as Wikieducator, LeMill, Connexions, Wikiversity,
      Educommons, OCW, etc.) may turn out to be particiularly significant in this regard.</para>
    <para id="element-55">Some education systems are moving in compatible directions. In South
      Africa there has been a move towards “outcomes-based education (and
      training)” - OBE(T). <link url="http://www.saqa.org.za/show.asp?main=structure/nqf/docs/curricul2005.html&amp;menu=docspol">http://www.saqa.org.za/show.asp?main=structure/nqf/docs/curricul2005.html&amp;menu=docspol</link></para>
    <para id="element-845">One would assume that once the required outcomes are defined, there is
      some freedom permitted in the approach to achieving those objectives. The materials produced
      in this process are released to the public domain. However, the process seems bogged down in
      bureaucracy and the complexities of gaining approval from SAQA. It has also proved difficult
      to convince educators to change their ways towards becoming facilitators of technology
      assisted learning (rather than fountains of knowledge).</para>
    <para id="element-385">The Thutong portal <link url="http://www.thutong.org.za/">http://www.thutong.org.za/</link> is becoming “freedom-friendly” by
      including a meta-data field for the license of learning objects along with a host of others to
      enable effective search. It is not a wiki environment however, and cbpp is not yet
      accommodated within the portal itself.</para>
    <para id="element-591">The (world-wide) challenge is to go ahead and create learning resources
      which embed cbpp among the learning activities, encourage wide use of the resources and the
      approach, to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness. In a Wiki environment (e.g.
      Wikieducator, Wikiversity, etc.) this is likely to be almost automatic.</para>
    <para id="element-565">Another question that arises is “How do we integrate software
      development into this process?”</para>
    <para id="element-570">Not everyone can or desires to develop software. I recall learning a lot
      about ecological processes through modelling. At the time, we mostly used spreadsheets and the
      programmers in the class were happy to share their knowledge in exchange for ecological
      insights. Together we produced models which seemed plausible. Although these models were not
      capable of quantitative prediction, they did illustrate the effects of variables on the
      systems under investigation, and helped us understand the processes. The key to this is either
      deskilling software development, or collaboration across disciplines. Raise awareness among
      FLOSS developers of the needs in education and encourage them to work with educators and
      learners. This is a good way to demonstrate the value of shared knowledge in problem solving.</para>
    <para id="element-953">[A project I encountered some time ago intended to do something similar
      for non-profit organisations, though it seems more general now: <link url="http://www.socialsourcecommons.org/">http://www.socialsourcecommons.org/</link> ]</para>
    <para id="element-839">One of the take-home messages from the modelling exercise above was that
      the real value of modelling is in the learning and insight gained through the modelling
      process (i.e. as opposed to the models produced or their qualitative predictions).</para>
    <para id="element-395">Here is a useful set of models for learning physics I discovered some
      time ago: <link url="http://phet-web.colorado.edu/">http://phet-web.colorado.edu/</link></para>
    <para id="element-202">Would it make sense to construct learning activities with incomplete
      versions of such software – students could then develop the programs (e.g. define
      formulae) their own way as part of the learning. The complete source code would represent a
      solution to the exercise?</para>
    <para id="element-942">In a wiki environment, I can imagine pages on specific needs for a piece
      of software, describing new use cases which software developers might like to implement in
      collaboration with the learners etc. as part of their software engineering programmes.</para>
    <para id="element-548">In terms of content development, I recently heard of a project using
      collaborative video production as a means of “crossing cultural
      borders”.</para>
    <para id="element-171">The great thing about software development and video co-production, is
      that they are sufficiently complex to require some co-planning, role and design negotiation,
      critical thinking and technical skill. Here is a project which emphasises a general ability
      which all learners should acquire through school: “… the skill of
      analysis. … the ability to break a complex problem into pieces, identify familiar
      patterns in the pieces, solve them using existing tools, and synthesize the results into a
      view or answer.” <link url="http://www.kusasa.org/">http://www.kusasa.org/</link></para>
    <para id="element-270">“We want to ensure that learners graduate with this ability,
      making them effective, successful, productive and fulfilled members of society.”</para>
    <para id="element-454">It might be useful to extend some of the ideas here into other levels of
      education and introduce social constructionist learning and cbpp in the development of the
      tool</para>
    <para id="element-45">For content production, see also <link url="http://www.elephantsdream.org/">http://www.elephantsdream.org/</link> as an example of
      an open movie built with FLOSS (www.blender.org) and with production files freely available. </para>
    <para id="element-218">Much of the above type of activity is happening already (links welcome),
      we are not short of ideas and encouraging such activities can only help - even if it is done
      in low/no connectivity environments, and is seen as nurturing the existing culture of
      collaboration and sharing in readiness for cbpp when access for all becomes a reality. </para>
    <para id="element-714">I think we agree that the people in Africa are likely to take to cbpp
      quite naturally on account of the traditional cultures, and by being less affected by the
      artificial barriers.</para>
    <para id="element-78">In summary, embedding cbpp across curricular is recommended, and
      generating a culture of collaborative learning is a good idea, though the impact may be
      delayed and less pronounced in places where access is limited. FLOSS and collaborative
      free/libre/open content development may serve as good vehicles to promote cbpp, though the
      required culture of sharing may be nurtured even without the Internet.</para>

    <para id="element-353">Hey Kim - Enabling access is a strategic priority in Africa -
      couldn’t agree more. In addition to enabling access - I would like to add a
      left-brain strategy, namely projects which generate universal demand for access - in other
      words generating the need for access in parallel to technical infrastructure.</para>
    <para id="element-999">For this reason I believe that libre content is a missing link in the

      more free content we can produce - the greater the need for access.</para>
    <para id="element-177">Conceptually it is possible to provide access to the 1.7 million free

      and I would like to focus on a small group of them that flowed from a question that I asked in

    <para id="element-889">
      <cite><cite-title>Would it help to generate a culture that supports and actively promotes peer
        development, investment in technologies that support collaborative creation, law that favors
        (reduces barriers and creates incentives) community production, etc?</cite-title></cite>

      <cite><cite-title>Would it help what? (reduce inequalities of access to knowledge/learning?).</cite-title></cite>
    </para>
    <para id="element-945">Yes, it seems that complex problems are not well suited to centralized
      and authoritarian solution generation and decision-making. Traditional “top of the
      pyramid” oriented decision making tends to disproportionably (sometimes
      exclusively) respect and reflect the values of the decision maker or the group that he or she
      represents. This will frequently result in marginalizing, to varying degrees (sometimes
      extremely), the values held by other less powerful groups. By definition, the decision maker
      is in some sort of local power position, which might extend to a global scale depending on the
      nature of the political and economic organization that the decision-maker is representing. I
      see commons-based peer development as a method to normatively balance concentration of power
      with the investment of communal decision-making. I was really pointing to commons-based peer
      development as a way of seeding values in organizations. Education is an important area
      because of its impact on the development and transmission of values. These values are then
      imbued, ala Freire, in the cultural artifacts that are created, which could include learning
      materials, technologies, organizational structure, governance, etc. There is a positively
      reinforcing cycle that starts with applying principles of commons-based peer development to
      OER and FLOSS, including the methods in teacher education, and the general curriculum, keeping
      in mind that curriculum extend outside of the “schoolhouse”.</para>

    </para>
    <para id="element-234">I might have at least partially responded to this question above, while
      also perhaps exposing a certain naivety and idyllic notion of how things work, or at least
      might work. A culture that supported the underlying values of commons-based peer development
      would benefit everybody because it would, I think, lead to a sustainable society. This of
      course assumes that as individual and societies we never really have enough resources to meet
      everybody’s appetites. That is, if left to market forces we will always have
      unlimited wants and needs and limited resources. On a societal scale wealth and resources are
      concentrated creating inequity, which is not a humane or sustainable way to manage a society
      or planet. Everybody feels the consequences eventually. This obviously is not only about
      social change, it is also about effective teaching and learning and basic access to quality
      and locally relevant educational resources, but if we can move mountains in the process, why
      not?</para>

    <para id="element-515">Great question, no, I do not think that this starts only after everybody
      has access to computers and the Internet. I will follow your and Wayne’s lead on
      this. Commons-based peer development, OER, FLOSS, CIT, education, crime, economic development,
      etc. are all part of an ecosystem that that will develop together, systemically, and
      holistically. Investment in developing paper-based OER using commons-based peer development
      will create demand for CIT, and CIT will become more impactful when they are made available if
      a process and culture of commons-based peer development is already in place. This will be
      particularly true if commons-based peer development is already being taught as part of the
      curriculum and being modeled in educational environments including schools</para>

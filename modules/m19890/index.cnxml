    <para id="id24325935">I want to welcome Cole and thank him for agreeing to contribute to the Impact of Open Source Software and Open Educational Resources on Education series on Terra Incognita. Cole will be looking at how the Web is finally starting to fulfill its promise as a platform to support and extend conversations. Faculty and students are engaging in the use of social media to participate in unprecedented ways — creating, mashing, and embedding content from all over the Internet is the becoming the new norm. What should we be doing inside the academy to understand and embrace this new form of literacy? In this post we’ll attempt to investigate the changing role of the web as a platform and ask some critical questions about our own future.</para>

Camplese serves as the Director of <link url="http://ets.tlt.psu.edu/" window="new">Education Technology Services</link> at the Pennsylvania State University. As Director, it is his responsibility to oversee University-wide initiatives with a focus on impacting teaching and learning with technology. He guides teams in the appropriate uses of technologies in the contexts of teaching and learning. His primary area of focus is the integration of emerging technologies into learning spaces. At Penn State, the overwhelming challenge is providing scalable solutions that the nearly 90,000 students and 5,000 faculty can successfully use to enhance their teaching and learning environments.</para>
    <para id="id22414872">Camplese has recently worked to integrate several new emerging technologies into curricular activities at Penn State to support digital expression. He and his team have lead the creation of the <link url="http://blogs.psu.edu/" window="new">Blogs at Penn State</link>, <link url="http://podcasts.psu.edu/" window="new">Podcasts at Penn State</link>, and the <link url="http://digitalcommons.psu.edu/" window="new">Digital Commons</link>. Camplese oversees the annual <link url="http://symposium.tlt.psu.edu/" window="new">Symposium for Teaching and Learning with Technology</link>, several community development events, and numerous other initiatives designed to support the adoption of technology for teaching and learning.</para>
    <para id="id19919146">I have now had the opportunity to work directly with Cole for longer than 2 years at Penn State, and have always found it enjoyable. I am very excited about having Cole contribute to the Impact series and look forward to some active participation and development of dialog. Cole’s post is scheduled for November 5, 2008. Please feel free to comment (early and often!), ask questions, build on the conversation, and enjoy.</para>

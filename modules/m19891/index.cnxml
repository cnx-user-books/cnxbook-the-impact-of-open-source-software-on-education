    <para id="id3526535">I want to welcome Martin Weller and thank him for agreeing to contribute to the Impact of Open Source Software and Open Educational Resources on Education series on Terra Incognita. Martin will be discussing the SocialLearn project, which is the Open University’s attempt to create an open API-based social networking system for learning. He will look at some of the motivations behind the project, what it hopes to achieve and how the technology is being used as the medium through which the institution itself comes to understand the changes happening in society and in education as a result of digital technologies.</para>

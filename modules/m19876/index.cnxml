Leigh Blackall has suggested that we do a synchronous web-conference to discuss aspects of the Otago Polytechnic experience, OER, and other aspects of his posting. The conference time is set for Friday, December 7, 2007 at 12:00 noon Eastern Standard Time, which would be December 7th at 17:00 Greenwich Mean Time, and December 8th at 6:00 (AM) New Zealand Daylight Time.
